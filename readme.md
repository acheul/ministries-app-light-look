# Ministries-app Light Look
* The Ministries-app crawls each ROK Govt' ministries' online annoucement reports and help users to conveniently look them up - instead of visiting each departments' sites.
* It's built on Django and used to be run on an aws server. (not in actual service at this moment.)
* Here are some light looks of the app.
